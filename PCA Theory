Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and 
bring out strong patterns in a dataset.

It's often used to make data easy to explore and visualize. It standardize dataset.
It reduces problem of overfitting.

First, consider a dataset in only two dimensions, like (height, weight). This dataset can 
be plotted as points in a plane. But if we want to tease out variation, PCA finds a new 
coordinate system in which every point has a new (x,y) value.

The axes don't actually mean anything physical; they're combinations of height and 
weight called "principal components" that are chosen to give one axes lots of variation.
No of Principal component can be less than or equal to no of attribute.

PCA is a tool for identifying the main axes of variance within a data set and allows for 
easy data exploration to understand the key variables in the data and spot outliers.

One of the most important applications of PCA is for speeding up machine learning 
algorithms.
